# smartChessBoard
Smart chess board code using python.

This project was developed by Emma Liedler, Matthew Williams, Ian Kirkpatrick and Thomas Benzshawel

The main goal for this project was to design and develop a chess board that could teach new players the rules of chess without needing to play against another player that simply always wins. We achieved this by developing a chess board with built in LED lights within the board that notifies the player what moves they could make whenever they pick up a piece.

Our first aproach started off as a development of the board by using RFID tags and sensors to keep track of which piece was where. However, we quickly found that this was not a finincial, or space effiecient aproach and instead swapped to using switches. In future iterations, we intend to use magnets instead of switches for the piece detection. These solutions and all physical board aspects were developed by Emma and Matthew

Finally, all code was developed from scratch by Thomas and Ian. The main goal was tor try and make our own chess engine that could easily inegrate itself into the logic of getting physical board info, and keeping track of the moves each piece can make. It is known that our aproach is NOT the most efficient way to develop the engine, but the main goal was to create our own using no outside resources.
